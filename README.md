#### Machine Learning Workflow

The machine learning workflow consists of following.
1. Problem Statement: Identify the problem
2. Data Collection: Gather the data to solve your problem
3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Analyze basic statistics and patterns of the data and prepare the data for machine learning
4. Modeling: Build a model based on the data
5. Validation: Test the model on new data
6. Decision Making and Deployment: Deploy the model to solve the problem.

The mermaid diagram below shows the workflow.
